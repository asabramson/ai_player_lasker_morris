# AI Player for Lasker Morris

This repository contains code for the AI player and a player that returns random moves. For proper documentation and instructions for use, visit my projects site repository [available here](https://github.com/asabramson/aaron-projects-site). The site can be pulled and ran locally, which contains a frontend interface for users to play against the AI player (I have only managed to beat it in rare cases, it only takes one move that is not the perfectly optimal choice to guarantee a stalemate or loss!). If you wish to try it without having to run the entire frontend (which requires installing Flask + other dependencies), instructions for running it in the Python terminal exist right above the main method, which should be uncommented. The game board tiles are named with letters a-g on the horizontal axis and numbers 1-7 on the vertical axis.
